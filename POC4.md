# POC 4 - Reverse Shell to Remain on Device

## Description

A reverse shell attack is an attack which allows attacker to open ports within the victim's machine. These opened ports allow the attackers to remotely access the victims organisation's network. 

These reverse shell's may be difficult to detect as threat actors may build more complex scripts to evade both the firewall implemented within the system as well as the antivirus implemented.

This attack aims to outline the threats posed to the organisation from a reverse shell attack. 

## Steps to Carry Out Exploitation



## Possible Mitigations and Recommendations

1. Disable unused ports
2. Configure the firewall to allow only required application's application ID*
3. Update antivirus signature database

**NOTE**
*Only applicable to Layer 7 Firewalls
