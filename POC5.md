# POC 5 - Ransomware to Destroy Files

## Description

Ransomware is a form of malware which is designed to encrypt files within a device and rendering files and systems to be useless. After the files are encrypted, threat actors usually demand a ransom in exchange for the key to decrypt the files within the system.

While some Organisations pay the threat actor for the key, it is not a guarantee that the threat actor will honour their words and provide the correct decryption key. This will result in Organisations losing their reputation, money and files from the attack. 

This attack aims to outline the threats posed to the organisation from a Ransomeware attack. 

## Steps to Carry Out Exploitation

1. Perform Backup Regularly and Restore Offline Backup
2. Crisis Management Plan
3. Update antivirus signature database
